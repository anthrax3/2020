In the past, Androids used an old trusted technology to keep a secret that was shared by each Android that connected to an Internet of Things node. TEEs were a promising technology. We were able to find and access one of these devices. Now, we believe it holds the key to understanding communication between the Androids.

Our engineers were able to redo almost the entire environment, using the 3.8.0 version of OP-TEE, but were unable to find the key. Can you help us?

We suspect of the trusted application deadbeef-dead-dead-dead-deaddeadbeef.ta

The Android service has some time limits: 

(1) Time limit for taking proof of work; 

(2) Time limit for delivering information for connection; 

(3) Time limit within the system.

We need your help!
