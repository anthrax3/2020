Rebellious Fingers got a low privilege backdoor in one of ButcherCorp's machines. The box is connected to the remains of a captured rebel android and it is being used to study their behaviors. There's not much left of the machine other than it's wireless omninet interface and a chip running the hkernel. Radio frequency analysis showed this machine is very active, as if it's trying to send a message to other androids. We could only get a sample of the programs that encrypt the message before it is sent and we need you to find out what is the message the android is trying to send.

**Note:** 

The box is a default instance running on GCP (N1 Series).

Getting root access is not necessary.

The "encoder" binary is running on the server.

Your payload (in binary format) will be executed for 5 seconds only.

**Server:** nc stolenbd.pwn2.win 1337
