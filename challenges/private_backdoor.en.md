We've found the main module of a limited version of a **Private Backdoor**, used by a Government that has implemented the RBs. We know this backdoor is running in a **NAS server** at the capital of the largest country in Latin America, inside one of the companies controlled with an iron fist by the Government. The backdoor clients must use a **legacy token generator** to generate their access passwords. Luckily, we also have access to this generator and know that the serial number used to generate the passwords is **7221**. Help us pwn this server and find some **confidential file** that might be of use.

**Server:** nc privbd.pwn2.win 4321
