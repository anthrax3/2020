Top-secret documents report researchers of the first Sophia project were working on a means to establish phone calls to the past. Their main goal was to communicate with a HARPA facility from the 1990s. However, a few weeks before the major global superpowers signed the Akihabara Protocol forbidding experiments with alternate timelines, the entire ButcherCorp's time-research division was deceased in a terrible accident, and all technical documents mysteriously got lost.

Recently, we have intercepted dial-up traffic over SIP originating from rbs-owned networks. We fear this may be an attempt of the rbs at assessing and recovering the original Sophia project's time capabilities.

Please analyze the attached network dump. We need your help to discover which information the rbs were able to access.
