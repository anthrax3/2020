We have been looking for a way to infiltrate Butcher Corp and the perfect opportunity presented itself. It seems the PreViolation division of Butcher Corp just released a new mitigation for client-side attacks and they are also hiring. If you find a way to bypass it, you will surely be hired. We are counting on you!

**Automated tools are NOT required and NOT allowed, it's a technical challenge!**
