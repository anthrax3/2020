Through reverse engineering work on Pixel 6, we identified the ButcherCorp server responsible for programming the RBSes. Our exploration team was only able to have limited access to this machine and extract the binaries from the programming service. As it runs with high privilege, exploiting it will allow us to extract more data from that server. Those data will bring us closer to the discovery of the person responsible for the Rebellion. Can you help us with this task?

**Server:** nc command.pwn2.win 1337
